        <ul><li class="color1">Reduce Single-Use Plastics</li></ul>
        <p>Plastic production is a significant and growing contributor to climate change, and microplastics harm the nature and human health. But what do we do when so many essential consumer items are bundled in and born out of this hard-to-recycle material? First, don’t ignore—then, collaborate with TNC and others in calling on world leaders to give consumers better options than the plastic industry. </p>
        <br>
        <ul><li class="color2">Say “Not So Fast” to Fast Fashion</li></ul>
        <p>Fast fashion relies on the rapid production of clothing, use lots of amounts of natural resources and is often made from synthetic materials like polyester, which release microplastics. These microplastics, invisible to the naked eye, are toxic. During clothing manufacturing, microfibers and plastics are released and estimates indicate that textile production is on track to triple by 2050. Fast fashion also promotes a throwaway culture, where clothes are quickly discarded after a few uses, leading to massive land pollution. Millions of tons of discarded clothes end up in landfills, taking hundreds of years to decompose and releasing harmful greenhouse gases and toxins.</p>
        <br>
        <ul><li  class="color3">Make Sustainable Purchases </li></ul>
        <p>In addition to making more sustainable decisions around your clothing purchases, you can also make sustainable choices for your other needs.</p>
        <br>
        <ul><li  class="color4">Reduce your food waste</li></ul>
        <p>Globally, around 931 million tones of food is wasted each year. In the US alone, approximately 60 million tons of food is wasted annually, equating to nearly 40% of the entire US food supply. When this waste ends up in landfills, it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions that increase climate change. </p>
        <br>
        <ul><li  class="color5">Address Wastewater</li></ul>
        <p>The pollution threatens biodiversity, especially in the ocean. While the environmental impact is significant, transformational solutions exist!</p>
        <br>
        <ul><li class="color6">Go Digital</li></ul>
        <p>Reducing your paper waste by switching from printed materials to digital formats can affectively reduce your carbon emissions. While digital devices do consume energy, the overall energy usage is much lower compared to the entire lifecycle of printed materials.</p>
        <br>
        <ul><li class="color7">Challenge Leaders to Do Better</li></ul>
        <p>Challenging leaders to improve their approach to waste management can make a significant difference. When leaders are pushed to set higher standards, they are more likely to implement effective policies and invest in sustainable technologies. By holding leaders, we can make changes that lead to more efficient resource  we use, reduced pollution, and a healthier planet.</p>
